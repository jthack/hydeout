I used to wear my sleep deprivation like a badge of honor. Four hours of sleep? Look how dedicated I am. Pulling all-nighters to finish projects? That's just hustle. Then I started snapping at my kids, losing patience with my spouse, and feeling spiritually dry no matter how much I prayed.

Turns out, I wasn't being dedicated. I was being foolish.

## Jesus Took Naps

Here's something that blew my mind when I actually thought about it: Jesus slept. Like, intentionally. The Son of God, who had roughly three years to save humanity, took a nap in a boat during a storm (Mark 4:38). He wasn't stressed about His to-do list. He wasn't answering emails at midnight.

If Jesus prioritized rest, maybe we should pay attention.

## The Fruit of the Spirit Requires a Rested Brain

You know that list in Galatians 5? Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Now think about the last time you were running on four hours of sleep.

How patient were you? How gentle? How much self-control did you have when someone cut you off in traffic?

Here's the thing: sleep deprivation literally impairs the prefrontal cortex. That's the part of your brain responsible for emotional regulation, decision-making, and impulse control. In other words, it's the part that helps you actually live out the fruit of the Spirit.

You can't white-knuckle your way to Christlikeness when your brain is running on fumes.

## 3 Ways Sleep Deprivation Sabotages Your Faith

1. **It kills your patience.** Studies show that sleep-deprived people have significantly lower frustration tolerance. That coworker who annoys you? Your toddler asking "why" for the 47th time? You need a rested brain to respond like Jesus would.

2. **It clouds your judgment.** Ever made a terrible decision when exhausted? Sleep deprivation affects your brain similarly to being drunk. Not exactly the state you want to be in when discerning God's will.

3. **It steals your joy.** Chronic sleep loss is strongly linked to depression and anxiety. Hard to experience the joy of the Lord when your brain chemistry is working against you.

## Rest Is an Act of Faith

This is the part that convicted me most. When I refuse to sleep because I have too much to do, I'm essentially saying, "God, I don't trust You to handle things while I rest."

That's not dedication. That's pride.

The Israelites had to learn this with manna. God told them to rest on the Sabbath and trust that He'd provide. Some of them didn't listen and went out gathering anyway. Sound familiar?

When you close your laptop at a reasonable hour and go to bed, you're making a statement: "God is in control, and I am not."

## Practical Steps to Actually Do This

1. **Set a bedtime alarm.** Seriously. Your phone tells you to wake up but not when to start winding down. Change that.

2. **Create a shutdown ritual.** I spend 10 minutes reviewing the next day, then I'm done thinking about it. It helps my brain let go.

3. **Reframe rest as obedience.** This shifted everything for me. Sleep isn't laziness. It's trusting God's design for your body.

4. **Start with one extra hour.** You don't need to overhaul your life overnight. Just go to bed 30 minutes earlier for a week. Then another 30 minutes.

## The Irony of It All

We stay up late trying to be productive, trying to do more for God, trying to be better people. And then we're too exhausted to be kind to the person right in front of us.

I've found that I accomplish more meaningful work and treat people better when I'm well-rested than when I'm grinding on empty. It's not even close.

You want to be more Christlike? Get some sleep. Your spouse will notice. Your kids will notice. Your coworkers will notice.

And honestly? You might finally have the mental clarity to hear what God's been trying to tell you all along.
