Sleep is one of those things everyone knows they should do more of, but most of us still don't prioritize it. I get it,there's always one more bug to find, one more episode to watch, or one more project to finish.

But here's what changed my mind about sleep.

### The Compound Effect of Better Sleep

I used to love pulling all-nighters while hacking. There's something about the quiet hours when everyone else is asleep that feels productive. But then I discovered something that completely shifted my perspective.

Better sleep doesn't just make you less tired. It fundamentally changes your ability to make good decisions throughout the day.

Here's what I learned:

1. **Sleep directly impacts willpower** - When you're well-rested, saying no to that second donut becomes easier. Your brain literally has more resources to resist temptation.

2. **Exercise becomes less of a battle** - Ever notice how when you're tired, the couch looks way more appealing than the gym? With proper sleep, that mental resistance decreases significantly.

3. **Your work quality improves** - This was the big one for me. More sleep means finding bugs faster, writing cleaner code, and making fewer mistakes that cost hours to fix later.

### Why This Matters More Than You Think

Think about it this way: most productivity hacks require you to add something to your routine. Sleep is different. You're already doing it - you just need to do it better.

[personal anecdote about discovering a critical bug after getting proper sleep here]

When I started prioritizing sleep, the results were immediate:
- Better focus during incident response
- Clearer thinking when making security decisions
- More patience when teaching junior team members
- Less time wasted on fixing careless mistakes

### Making Sleep a Priority

The hard part isn't understanding that sleep is important. It's actually doing it. Here's what worked for me. **I set a hard cutoff time**. So no screens, no "just one more thing", gotta just go to bed.

I guess my main point is this: sleep is the ultimate life hack because it makes you more likely to make the right decisions.

### For Christians: A Deeper Realization

I had another powerful realization about the effect of willpower that completely changed how I view sleep.

When I'm tired, I don't just make worse technical decisions. I'm less patient with my kids, less kind to my spouse, less loving to those around me. Basically, I sin more.

Think about that for a moment. More sleep literally equals more holy behavior.

That's POWERFUL.

And convicting. This realization makes it much easier to pull myself away from whatever I'm doing and go to bed on time. It's not just about health anymore, it's about living out my faith in a better way.

Also, think about it, God himself prioritized rest. He built it into the very fabric of creation. The commandment about honoring the Sabbath isn't just a suggestion, it's a recognition that we're designed to need rest. The word "Shabbat" literally means "to cease."

If the Creator of the universe built rest into His design, who am I to think I can function better without it?

Sleep isn't just a productivity hack. It's a spiritual discipline that affects every area of your life. And that makes it worth prioritizing.
