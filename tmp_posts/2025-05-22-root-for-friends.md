## What *is* "Root For Your Friends"?

It's getting excited for your friends when something good happens, and rejecting jealousy.

It's deeply believing that **a rising tide lifts all boats**.

It's understanding that most games in life aren't zero‑sum; they're wildly *positive‑sum*. 

**Outcomes**: If you read this post, you will be more:
- excited for your friends
- generous with your praise and support
- open to collaborating with others
- likely to introduce your friends to people who can help them

**Note**: I call a friend who roots for you a **hypeman** or a **hype friend**.

## The Hypeman Flywheel

The most underrated part of rooting for you friends is that it benefits everyone. A **flywheel** is a concept where each input creates a positive feedback loop that improves the next loop. 

A good example of a flywheel in business is where a company collectus and utilizes user analytics such that their improvement of the product means more people use the product, which creates more data for what's working, which creates a better product, which drives morepeople to use the product, etc.

The **friend flywheel** is similar. It's a positive feedback loop where you root for your friends, building them up and sharing info with them which creates good will and levels them up, and now they're slightly more successful and informed and they often share info and deals back with you due to feeling closer with you. Then you level up and get access to more info and better deals and you share with them, and the flywheel keeps going.

### One Caveat

Obviously the flywheel only works if your friends reciprocate. 

Alex Hormozi says "The best way to change your life is to change your friends." You don't have to do this, but if you're reading this and the quote resonates with you, maybe you should consider it.

Look for friends who aren't threatened by your success. I talk about spotting friend who will "root for you" in a second.

### A caveat of the caveat

Even if you root for the "wrong" friends, it's still the best way to live. Life is better not feeling jealous. You can sleep so much easier at night by genuinely being happy for your friends, even if they're a bit jealous of you.

### Root For Your Friends—in a Question

Visualize something for me. 

> You just shipped a side‑project that lands on the front page of Hacker News. Your phone lights up.
> **Who's the first person you want to tell?**
> 
> That person is your **hypeman**—the friend who celebrates your victories like it's their own milestone.

### Root For Your Friends Moments

The best examples of RFYR (Root For Your Friends) are from sports. I think it's because the stakes are slightly lower than business, but honestly it's cool and surprising because sports are zero sum. There's only one winner or champion in sports. 

* **1997, Silicon Valley** – PayPal employees invest in and advise each other's spin‑offs (YouTube, Yelp, LinkedIn, SpaceX). One win became dozens because the crew kept passing the baton around.
* **2016, Rio Olympics** – Mid-race, runners Abbey D'Agostino (USA) and Nikki Hamblin (New Zealand) collide and fall. Instead of sprinting ahead, Abbey helps Nikki to her feet, and they finish the race together, embodying true sportsmanship. Both athletes received special Olympic commendations for embodying the Olympic spirit.
* **2017, Tennis** – Serena Williams, sidelined temporarily, publicly and personally coached and cheered on sister Venus Williams during Venus’s deep Wimbledon run. Venus credited Serena’s constant insights as a key factor in reaching her first Wimbledon final in nearly a decade—renewing attention for both sisters and creating mutual opportunities for sponsorship and growth.
* **2022, Formula 1** – After engine failure knocked Charles Leclerc out of a critical race, he immediately shifted to coaching teammate Carlos Sainz via radio, helping Sainz secure his first-ever Formula 1 victory. This selfless pivot turned a frustrating personal loss into a team-wide milestone.
