Over 10 years ago, I assembled this self "liturgy" of sorts (basically just a prayer) that I love reading. It takes a bunch of my favorite verses but changes them to first-person perspective. Something about first person makes it much more powerful and personal. I pray it encourages you greatly. 

I love You, LORD, my strength.

You are my rock, my fortress and my deliverer, my shield and the horn of my salvation,

my stronghold; in You I take refuge$^1$

“You bore my sins” in Your body on the cross, so that I might die to sins and live for righteousness;

“by Your wounds I have been healed.”$^2$

You are the way, the truth, and the life.$^3$

I am convinced that nothing can separate me from Your love.$^4$

I will be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.$^5$

All authority has been given to me; therefore I will go and make disciples.$^6$

I will not be afraid, I will only believe.$^7$

For you did not give me a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love, and of self-discipline.$^8$

Whatever happens, I will conduct myself in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ.$^9$

I will fight the good fight, I will finish the race, I will keep the faith.$^{10}$

I will not love the world or anything in the world for the world and its desires will pass away

but if I do Your will, I will live forever.$^{11}$

Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.$^{12}$

And I will see Your face.$^{13}$

I do all things for Your glory and in the name of Jesus Christ.

Amen
