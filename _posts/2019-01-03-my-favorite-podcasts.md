I love podcasts. I've listened to quite a few in the last few years. Here's my favorites:

## 1. Best Running Podcast: Running Rogue

Steve Sisson and Chris McClung are coaches at Rogue Running in Austin, TX. They have great running
resumes. Their podcast is great because it's entertaining, extremely informative, and they cover
everything from beginner's tips to interviewing professionals. 

## 2. Best Security Podcast: Security Now

Steve Gibson has been cranking out episodes for over 10 years. The episodes are comprehensive in
regards to security events week to week, but explained so well that anyone familiar with basic
security concepts can understand. 

## 3. Best Christian Podcast: This Cultural Moment

This Cultural Moment is a cultural commentary on the state of Christianity and Secularism in the west.
John Mark Comer of Bridgetown Church in Portland and Mark Sayers of Red Church in Melbourne,
Australia make extremely insightful observations about faith in a culture that's becoming more
secular.

## 4. Best Random Podcast: Hello Internet

CGPGrey and Brady Haran are masters of content creation in the 21st century. Hello Internet is what
podcasting is all about. Two guys talking about nothing in particular. They are both
youtubers turned podcasters. CGPGrey is also on Cortex. Brady is also on the Unmade Podcast. Both
are good as well.
