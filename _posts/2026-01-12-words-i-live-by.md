Over 10 years ago, I put together a self "liturgy" of sorts (basically just a prayer) that I love reading. It takes a bunch of my favorite verses but changes them to the first-person perspective. There's something about first person that makes it much more powerful and personal. As you read this, I pray it encourages you greatly. 


_I love You, LORD, my strength._

_You are my rock, my fortress and my deliverer, my shield and the horn of my salvation,_

_my stronghold; in You I take refuge$^1$_

_“You bore my sins” in Your body on the cross, so that I might die to sins and live for righteousness;_

_“by Your wounds I have been healed.”$^2$_

_You are the way, the truth, and the life.$^3$_

_I am convinced that nothing can separate me from Your love.$^4$_

_I will be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.$^5$_

_All authority has been given to me; therefore I will go and make disciples.$^6$_

_I will not be afraid, I will only believe.$^7$_

_For you did not give me a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love, and of self-discipline.$^8$_

_Whatever happens, I will conduct myself in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ.$^9$_

_I will fight the good fight, I will finish the race, I will keep the faith.$^{10}$_

_I will not love the world or anything in the world for the world and its desires will pass away_

_but if I do Your will, I will live forever.$^{11}$_

_Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.$^{12}$_

_And I will see Your face.$^{13}$_

_I do all things for Your glory and in the name of Jesus._

_Amen_
