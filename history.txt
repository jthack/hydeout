Modified `blogger.py` to use Claude Opus 4 (claude-opus-4-20250514) for blog content generation while keeping GPT-4o for image prompt generation. Set temperature to 0.7 for more creative outputs and removed thinking capability parameters which were causing errors. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both models.

- Modified `blogger.py` to add a mode where blog content can be passed directly using a command-line argument `--content`. If provided, the script skips the content generation step and uses the given content for the rest of the pipeline. This allows for flexibility in processing pre-written blog content while maintaining the existing functionality for AI-generated content. 

- Enhanced the `--content` argument in `blogger.py` to accept input from stdin if no value is provided. This allows for flexibility in providing blog content either directly as an argument or through piping input into the script. 

- Updated `blogger.py` to read from stdin line by line until an EOF is encountered, improving handling of interactive input and preventing the script from hanging when using `pbcopy` or similar tools. 

Updated the _posts/2025-05-13-root-for-your-friends.md file by filling out the caveat section. The new content emphasizes the importance of choosing friends who reciprocate your energy and values, aligning with the post's overall message of mutual growth and support. 

Simplified the language in the caveat section of the _posts/2025-05-13-root-for-your-friends.md file. The updated content uses more straightforward language, avoiding words like 'catalyst', 'reciprocate', and 'wavelength', to make it more relatable and easier to understand. 

Added the new "Root for Your Friends" blog post (_posts/2025-05-13-root-for-your-friends.md) and its related images to git. The post includes five images: a banner image (root-for-your-friends-banner.png) and four supporting images that illustrate different aspects of the hypeman concept. These images are stored in the assets/images directory. 

Enhanced the invisible prompt injection tool in _layouts/invisible_prompt_injection.html to detect and highlight all non-viewable Unicode characters in addition to the existing Unicode tag character detection. Added comprehensive detection for control characters (C0/C1 controls like NULL, TAB, CR, LF, ESC, DEL), zero-width characters (ZWSP, ZWNJ, ZWJ), directional formatting characters (LRM, RLM, LRE, RLE, etc.), and other invisible Unicode characters like BOM, soft hyphens, and non-breaking spaces. The new functionality highlights these characters in red with descriptive labels (e.g., [NULL], [ZWSP], [BOM], [NBSP]) to distinguish them from Unicode tag characters which remain highlighted in cyan. Also added a visual legend to help users understand the different highlight colors. Fixed missing detection of non-breaking space (U+00A0) character. Added hover tooltips that show the Unicode hex code (e.g., "Character: U+00A0") for all highlighted characters with help cursor and subtle hover color changes.

Fixed hover tooltips in invisible prompt injection tool (_layouts/invisible_prompt_injection.html) - replaced unreliable browser title attribute tooltips with custom CSS tooltips that appear reliably when hovering over highlighted Unicode characters to show their hex codes.
